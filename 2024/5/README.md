I ended up implementing this solution 3 times, with linked lists, with arrays and with a sort comparison.

I did this because I didn't realize that for part 2 I only needed to include the updates that needed sorting, not all the updates.

This took me a really long time, like for real.

- Part 1 - 18 minutes
- Part 2 - 4hrs 40 minutes
